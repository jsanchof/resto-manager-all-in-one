# Implementation Plan

## Current Phase: Database and API Restructuring

### Phase 1: Database Schema Update
- [ ] Create Product base table with polymorphic relationship
- [ ] Migrate existing Dishes and Drinks to use Product inheritance
- [ ] Add ingredients and product_ingredients tables
- [ ] Add preparation_time and volume fields
- [ ] Create database migration scripts

### Phase 2: API Adaptation
- [ ] Update product-related endpoints to use new schema
- [ ] Maintain backwards compatibility during transition
- [ ] Add new endpoints for ingredient management
- [ ] Update order processing to handle new schema
- [ ] Add inventory tracking endpoints

### Phase 3: Test Implementation
- [ ] Create database fixtures for testing
- [ ] Implement unit tests for new models
- [ ] Add integration tests for updated APIs
- [ ] Create inventory management tests
- [ ] Test backwards compatibility
- [ ] Expand test coverage for all modules and endpoints (ongoing)
- [ ] Revisit and increase test coverage after each major refactor or feature addition

### Phase 4: CI/CD Updates
- [ ] Update CI workflow for new database schema
- [ ] Add test database initialization scripts
- [ ] Configure test environment variables
- [ ] Add inventory management checks

## Future Phases

### Phase 5: Inventory Management
- [ ] Real-time stock tracking
- [ ] Low stock alerts
- [ ] Automatic reorder points
- [ ] Usage analytics

### Phase 6: Recipe Management
- [ ] Ingredient cost calculation
- [ ] Recipe versioning
- [ ] Preparation instructions
- [ ] Allergen tracking

### Phase 7: Reporting
- [ ] Cost analysis reports
- [ ] Usage tracking
- [ ] Waste management
- [ ] Profit margins per product

## Current Issues and Adjustments (2024)

- Migration scripts are missing; must be created and versioned for all schema changes.
- Test coverage is minimal; expand both unit and integration tests for backend and frontend.
- Inventory and ingredient management endpoints are not yet implemented; prioritize these in upcoming sprints.
- CI/CD workflows need consolidation and secrets management (move hardcoded credentials to GitHub secrets).
- Ensure all new features are reflected in documentation and architecture files.
- The entry point for migrations and Flask app context is `src/app.py`.
- Create a Windows-compatible migration script (e.g., database.ps1 or database.bat) to mimic the Linux `database.sh` functionality for running migrations and upgrades.
- Refactor all route files to use their own Blueprint (e.g., orders_api, kitchen_api) instead of importing a shared 'api' object from __init__.py. This eliminates circular imports, which block migrations and app startup.
- Update routes/__init__.py to import and register each Blueprint individually.
- This change is required to allow Flask, Flask-Migrate, and Alembic to import the app and models cleanly, so migrations and the app itself will work.
- Resolved endpoint conflict in kitchen.py by updating the kitchen_required decorator to use functools.wraps, ensuring unique endpoint names for all routes.
- Migration scripts can now be generated and applied successfully after resolving all import and endpoint issues.
